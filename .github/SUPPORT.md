## Official Support

All Deepin apps are supported mainly on Deepin distro, we also would like to help user from other distro if they have any issue when using Deepin apps. You can find us at:

 - [Official Forum](https://bbs.deepin.org/)
 - [Developer-Center repo at GitHub](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/developer-center/issues)

> **Note**: If you are using other distro than Deepin, please consider report your issue to the package maintainer / bug tracker of your distro first. Different distributions often use different packages, package versions, repositories, or make custom system configurations silently, which made rendering support from Deepin become very hard.

For a bug report, please include as many details as possible, fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster. When posting issue to Developer Center, please read [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first.

If you have any other support request other than bug report, you can still create a new issue and describe your issue, or you can send a email to `support <at> deepin <dot> com` if you have special need.
