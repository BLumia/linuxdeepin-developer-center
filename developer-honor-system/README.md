## Note:

- Contribution scope: Developer contributions to the community are limited to code contributions to applications and components under the GitHub Linuxdeepin organization and software package maintenance under the GitHub deepin-community organization, including project updates and maintenance.
- Issue clarification: Code contributions should involve solving existing issues, updating repository software package versions, providing patches for upstream software packages, etc. If the number of issues raised by the developer exceeds 50% of the required issues for a particular level, they will no longer be counted. (Application packaging scenarios are not supported. Application packagers can follow community updates for a separate non-development version of the honor system.)
- Title clarification: Once the honorary title is awarded, it will not be revoked. Members with corresponding titles will be included in the Community Honor Wall. If a developer fails to meet the contribution requirements for three consecutive months, only the privileges will be revoked. (The Community Honor Wall has not been published yet, please be patient.)
- Recommendations: Recommendations primarily assess the applicant's open-source expertise, community influence, and reputation. Technical skills and willingness are the primary considerations.
- Privileges: The current Honor System is a trial version 1.0. Future privileges will be updated irregularly, including random easter eggs. (Before formal modifications to the privileges, a notice period of at least 1 month will be provided for revisions, with a public announcement period of no less than 7 days.)
- Account clarification: The current Honor System is based on Deepin ID and does not include team contribution scenarios. One Deepin ID corresponds to one GitHub account in a one-to-one relationship.
- Q&A: For account inquiries, rule clarifications, feedback, and suggestions, please visit https://matrix.to/#/#deepin-space:matrix.org for relevant feedback.
- Information notification: Community-related matters regarding levels will be communicated through the designated email [mailman@uniontech.com] (this email cannot receive replies). To avoid missing information, community members are advised to bind their Deepin ID email (email binding link: <https://account.deepin.org/> ).
